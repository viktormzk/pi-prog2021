 SQLite cool DB but not fast, program work in hundreds of time faster 
with .txt ot .dat ...
 The size of the stream file is always smaller...
 In SQLite .excel does not display columns correctly, 
all columns in column A in excel file, with "," 
where there should have been another column....
 If u work with cmd all ok, "SELECT * FROM foo;" 
work works correctly, through "|" between the columns.
 
 The end of first lab(maybe)...
